# Customer requests

Status: APPROVED
Version: 1.1

## Goal

Present the customer journey as a simple end-to-end **Request** without exposing
Agent/internal lifecycle terminology such as Lead, Student, or Application as
customer navigation concepts.

## Requirements

CRQ-001 — Customer-facing workspace navigation and request pages MUST use
**Request** terminology for the customer's case; Lead, Student, and Application
remain internal/Agent domain terminology.

CRQ-002 — The customer desktop sidebar MUST contain menu items only: **My
Requests**, **Messages**, **Get Help**, and, when configured, **Message us on
WhatsApp**. It MUST NOT render sidebar heading/subtitle copy such as “MY
TURKDEMY” or “Student workspace”.

CRQ-003 — **Get Help** MUST link to the existing Contact page. The WhatsApp item
MUST derive its number from the `WHATSAPP_NUMBER` environment-backed Django
setting, MUST NOT hard-code a number in templates, and MUST be hidden when no
number is configured.

CRQ-004 — **My Requests** MUST be the authenticated customer workspace landing
page and MUST expose a **Find Programs** page action linking to the public
Programs catalogue.

CRQ-005 — Each request card MUST show the request person's full name, email and
cell when available.

CRQ-006 — Each request card MUST show an **Applied for** section containing all
program interests associated with the request regardless of whether they were
added by the customer or suggested by an Agent. Agent-originated interests MUST
carry a small “Suggested by your agent” tip.

CRQ-007 — A request card MUST visibly indicate that action is required when the
request has unread incoming customer-visible messages or a document with
replacement requested.

CRQ-008 — The whole request card/row MUST be a single primary click target that
opens that request.

CRQ-009 — Desktop page actions MUST use the shared TurkDemy convention: top
right of the main section in LTR and top left in RTL. Mobile placement MAY adapt
to the most usable responsive layout.

CRQ-010 — The customer Request abstraction MUST NOT change the canonical
Lead→Student→Application backend lifecycle or Agent-facing terminology.

CRQ-011 — Each program entry in **Applied for** MUST render a non-empty program
name and university name from the canonical Program/University display fields;
missing/nonexistent template attributes MUST NOT produce placeholder separator-only
boxes.

CRQ-012 — Request cards MUST remain visually stable on pointer hover. Hover MUST
NOT add underline, movement, border changes, or shadow changes; clickability is
communicated by the card being a link/click target itself.

## Acceptance policy

Each requirement is accepted when its observable behavior is implemented and
covered by named tests or repository checks in traceability.
