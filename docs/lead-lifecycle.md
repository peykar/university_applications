# Lead lifecycle

Lead status is intentionally small and derived from real workflow state:

- `new`: created and not assigned to an agent user.
- `assigned`: `assigned_to` contains the agent user responsible for the lead.
- `finalized`: the lead has been converted to a `Student`.
- `closed`: the lead was explicitly closed without conversion.

All active users of the lead's `Agent` can see the lead. `assigned_to` represents
responsibility, not authorization. Any agent user with access to the lead can use
**Assign to me**, including taking responsibility from another user; the change is
recorded as a LeadActivity.

Closing is a manual terminal workflow action with optional `close_reason`,
`closed_by`, and `closed_at`. A closed lead can be reopened; it returns to
`assigned` when it still has an assignee, otherwise `new`.

Validation is not a lead status. `finalize_lead()` performs validation and records
validation metadata. Conversion to `Student` sets the lead status to `finalized`.
